<!-- ![Welcome, Fluid Flow](./assets/images/fluidflow.jpg) -->

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This website has some cool stuff about me i.e. Roussel Desmond Nzoyem (RD2N). You'll also find interesting stories about various topics in **hard science**, **cognitive sciences**, and some even more random stuff.

To learn more about me, go to the [About](/about.qmd) page. In [Projects](/projects.qmd), you'll find some work I've contributed to, along with the tech stack I've mastered over the years. For some very random stuff, go to [Blog](/posts.qmd) where you'll find a curated list of stories, articles, and poems. I hope you'll enjoy !
