<!-- ![Welcome, Fluid Flow](./assets/images/fluidflow.jpg) -->

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This website contains lots of cool stuff about it's creator and subject i.e. ME, and even more interesting stories about **science** and how it makes us **feel**.

To learn more about me, go to the [About](/about.qmd) page. In [Projects](/projects.qmd), you'll find some work I've contributed to, along with the tech stack I've mastered over the years. And for the most fun stuff, go to [Blog](/posts.qmd) where you'll find a curated list of articles. I hope you'll enjoy !
