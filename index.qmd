## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This website is about my professional journey. You'll also find interesting stories on various topics in **hard** and **cognitive sciences**, and some even more random stuff.

To learn more about me, go to the [About](/about.qmd) page. In [Projects](/projects.qmd), you'll find some work I've contributed to, along with the tech stack I've mastered over the years. For some very random stuff, go to [Blog](/posts.qmd) where you'll find a curated list of stories, articles, and poems. I hope you'll enjoy !
