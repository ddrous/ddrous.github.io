## Welcome üëãüèº

Hello there ! I'm **Roussel Desmond Nzoyem** (pronounced **zo-e-m**). To learn more about me, go to the [About](/about.qmd) and [CV](/cv.qmd) pages. You'll find some work I've contributed to in [Projects](/projects.qmd) and [Publications](/publications.qmd). For a nice read, go to the [Blog](/posts.qmd) section where you'll find interesting stories ranging many disciplines. Some very focused, and others quite random !



## Selected publications

A few of my HPC and ML publications are listed below. Please check the [Publications](/publications.qmd) section or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=80GLOSUAAAAJ&hl=en) for more papers.
