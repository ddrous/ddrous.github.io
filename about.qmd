Hi there ! I'm Des, a PhD student in HPC-AI at the University of Bristol. I'm investigating parallel algorithms for combined data-driven and physics-informed simulation, control, and 3D reconstruction from fluid flows.


**My research interests are at the intersection of Machine Learning, Scientific Computing, and High Performance Computing. They include:**

- How to best combine classical knowledge of physical systems with AI approaches ?
- How to scale existing physics-based AI techniques to real-world engineering problems: this involves questions like strong/weak scaling and uncertainty quantification.
- What role do humans, and domain scientists in particular play in the envisionned symbiose above?


To learn more about me, you can consult the list of [projects](/projects.qmd) I've been involved in. Also, here's a link to a short version of [my CV](https://www.rousseldesnzoyem.com/static/media/CV_Short.b1a8a9adbe072d8ec3b2.pdf). Ever better, send me a message !
