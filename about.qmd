Hi there ! I'm a PhD student in HPC-AI at the University of Bristol, investigating parallel algorithms for combined data-driven and physics-informed simulation and control. I'm advised by [Dr Tom Deakin](https://hpc.tomdeakin.com/), [Pr David Barton](https://cityinthesky.co.uk/about-me/), and [Pr Simon McIntosh-Smith](http://uob-hpc.github.io/SimonMS/).


My research interests are at the intersection of **Artificial Inteligence**, **Scientific Computing**, and **High Performance Computing**. Some of the questions I ponder are:

- How to best combine classical knowledge of physical systems with AI approaches ?
- How to scale existing physics-based AI techniques to real-world engineering problems: this involves questions like strong/weak scaling and uncertainty quantification.
- What role do humans and domain scientists in particular play in the envisionned systemic symbiose above ?
- The _parallel computational theory of the causal mind_ as broadly covered by John R. Searle in _Philosophy of Mind_ and Malcolm Gladwell in _Blink_.


For more details, please read [my CV](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddrous/fosblog/master/assets/pdfs/CV_Short.pdf), or view my profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roussel-desmond-nzoyem/).

:::

- All things computer hardware, software and games. From old classics like XX to AAA games like DOOM, nothing like a first-person shooter to evade your troubles.
- I play football weekly in the Bristol Suburban League with the Little Stokes **feared** A's team. 
- I've just recently taken back to playing the piano. Seriously this time. Find some of my pieces here.
- In another life, I'm pretty sure I am a moviemaker.



## Life

A few quotes and prayers can describe me better than any essay I could ever write:

- __God, give me the__ - The serenity prayer
- __Time waits for no one__ - A very famous movie quote
