Hi there ! I'm a PhD student in HPC-AI at the University of Bristol, investigating parallel algorithms for combined data-driven and physics-informed simulation and control. I'm advised by [Dr Tom Deakin](https://hpc.tomdeakin.com/), [Pr David Barton](https://cityinthesky.co.uk/about-me/), and [Pr Simon McIntosh-Smith](http://uob-hpc.github.io/SimonMS/).


My research interests are at the intersection of **Artificial Inteligence**, **Scientific Computing**, and **High Performance Computing**. Some of the questions I ponder are:

- How to best combine classical knowledge of physical systems with AI approaches ?
- How to scale existing physics-based AI techniques to real-world engineering problems: this involves questions like strong/weak scaling and uncertainty quantification.
- What role do humans and domain scientists in particular play in the envisionned systemic symbiose above ?
- The _parallel computational theory of the causal mind_ as broadly covered by John R. Searle in _Philosophy of Mind_ and Malcolm Gladwell in _Blink_.


For more details, read [my CV](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddrous/fosblog/master/assets/pdfs/CV_Short.pdf) or view my profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roussel-desmond-nzoyem/). If it grabs your attention, please do send me [a message](mailto:roussel.desmond.nzoyem@outlook.com).



## Cornerstones

A few quotes can describe me better than any essay I could ever write:

- _God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference_ - __The Serenity Prayer__
- _Time waits for no one_ - probably from __The Girl Who Leapt Through Time__
