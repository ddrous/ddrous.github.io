In recent years, numerical models using the Finite Elements Method (FEM) to simulate the soft tissue mechanisms of the human body have attracted a great interest. In the context of computer-assisted surgery, the simulation method should be quick, precise, and patient-specific. This work develops a new immersed boundary method named Ï†-FEM to address those issues.
