This is my very first post on this blog. \n\n\nI've never really owned a blog, even though it has been on my mind for more than 2 years now.

My biggest concern was that I couldn't write code like in iPython notebooks. The coding feature is something I value a lot for Data Science tutorials. The current iteration (version 3) is built on Quarto which fully supports in-line code cells in `Python` and `Julia`, my top 2 scripting languages. It offered a template more gorgeous than anything that I found elsewhere.\n\nNow that you know my reasons for making these changes, you can tell me which version you think is best. You can react below with üëç for version 1, üéâ for version 2, or ‚ù§Ô∏è for version 3.

It's super easy though. \n\n\nPlease go ahead and tell me which one's preferable so that I can incorporate the best of what that version has to offer. As always, thanks for reading !\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{css}\n#| echo: false\np {\n  text-align: justify\n}\n```\n\nWelcome!
