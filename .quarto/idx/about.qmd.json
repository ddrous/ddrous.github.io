I'm a PhD student in HPC-AI at the University of Bristol, investigating parallel algorithms for combined data-driven and physics-informed simulation and control. I'm advised by [Dr Tom Deakin](https://hpc.tomdeakin.com/), [Pr David Barton](https://cityinthesky.co.uk/about-me/), and [Pr Simon McIntosh-Smith](http://uob-hpc.github.io/SimonMS/).\n\n\nMy research interests are at the intersection of **Artificial Inteligence**, **Scientific Computing**, and **High Performance Computing**. Some of the questions I ponder are:\n\n- How to best combine classical knowledge of physical systems with AI approaches ?\n- How to scale existing physics-based AI techniques to real-world engineering problems: this involves questions like strong/weak scaling and uncertainty quantification.\n- What role do humans and domain scientists in particular play in the envisionned systemic symbiose above ?\n- The _parallel computational theory of the causal mind_ as broadly covered by John R. Searle in _Philosophy of Mind_ and Malcolm Gladwell in _Blink_.\n\n\nFor more details, read [my CV](cv.qmd) or view my profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roussel-desmond-nzoyem/).
