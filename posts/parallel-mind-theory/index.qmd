I've always been fascinated by the theory of the mind and how to fully replicate it. Lately, I've been finding the philosophical nature of the question more and more fascinating. This article is based on ideas I collected from John Searle's course  [_Philosophy of Mind_](https://youtu.be/zi7Va_4ekko), and Malcolm Gladwell's best-selling book [_Blink_](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Blink-Audiobook/B004F2Z324). Hoping not to get into too much detail, I'll talk about two technologies I believe are key to deciphering how the human mind works: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, and Time-Parallel Computing.



## The Mind-Body problem


The mystery of consciousness is one of the most challenging questions of our time. The Cartesian view postulates that there exists two realms: a real of __Mind__ (whose essence is the "thinking"), and a real of __Body__ (or the physical)[^1]. The mind is indivisible, undoubtable (hence the famous phrase "_I think, therefore I am._"), and it commands the body. Of course, this is a gross oversimplification of RenÃ© Descartes's legacy, whose ideas we carry to this day.

This formulation dating back to the 17th century is convenient for its time, as it leaves the realm of the Body to science, and the realm of the Mind to religion. Perfect if you're a scientist trying to conduct thought-provoking research under the Inquisition. Descartes's theory is appealing, but it leaves us with one big problem. How does the mind influence the brain ? How are the two realms connected ? Descartes's answer to this puzzle was unconvincing.

Over the centuries, several schools of thought have emerged, only considering one of the two realms. The main groups being __idealism__ and __behaviourism__, beautifully explained by John Searle in his course [Philosophy of Mind](https://youtu.be/zi7Va_4ekko). It would appear that the advent of computers and the emergence of the cross-disciplinary field of __cognitive science__ is the key to this puzzle.

## The causal brain

Computers function by means of algorithms: carefully established instructions relating an input to an output. If one were to think of the brain (and __daringly__ the mind too) as a computer, then the causal relation between the brain and the mind would have to be at the heart of such formalism. That is the essence of cognitive science.

When you feel hunger or joy, there's no doubt that these are neurobiological processes in your brain firing. This suggests that the mind reacts to the behaviour of the world, it is caused by brain processes. On the other hand, when you go from being unhappy to being ecstatic, we can clearly see a change in the physical disposition of your brain. In other words, your mind is a state of your brain, a feature.

As explained by Searle, the brain **causes** the mind, and the mind is a **feature** of the brain. This would appear paradoxical, but no, it isn't. It makes sense if we think of the mind as made up of the higher-level processes compared to what we measure in the brain.

__How do higher-level systemic features emerge from individual characteristics__? This is the research question we've been after. We've turned an abstract philosophical question into a very materialistic one; a scientific problem that includes the mind (unlike Descartes's original formulation). Examples of mind-blowing behaviour emerging from simplistic elementary processes are widespread in nature. My favourite example is the swirl of Starling birds.

::: {.callout-note}
This idea isn't particularly groundbreaking. I've recently heard on the [Joy of Why](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/the-joy-of-why/) podcast about Professor Anil Seth and his pursuit of similar research questions at the University of Sussex.
:::


As an applied mathematician, the propagation of brain signals and the causality principle between low- and high-level features remind me of two specific tools: __differential equations__ and __neural networks__. Therefore, I liken the causality and evolutionary nature of brain processes to ordinary differential equations (ODE): it describes the individual dynamics. I then ascribe the compositionality of such simple behaviour to form larger feature to Deep Neural Networks.

As it turns out, those two concepts have been merged in what is now known as [Neural ODEs](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/hash/69386f6bb1dfed68692a24c8686939b9-Abstract.html), typically formulated as follows:
\begin{align}
\frac{\text{d} y}{\text{d} t}(t) &= f_{\theta}(y,t), \qquad t \in ]t_0, t_f [ \\
y(t_0) &= y_0, \\
z(t) &= g_{\theta'}(\theta, y, y_0, t, t_0, t_f),
\end{align}
where $y$ represents the physical state in which the brain is in. The transformative function $f_{\theta}$ -- where the learnable parameters $\theta$ indicate a Deep Neural Network -- dictates how a physical signal is processed inside the brain. The mysterious **readout** function $g_{\theta'}$ tells us how a brain signal $y_0\in \mathbb{R}^b$ turns into a global mind feature $z \in \mathbb{R}^m$ (with $m\gg b$, potentially lots more parameters (neurons) involved in forming a mind than to process an elementary signal).

::: {.callout-note}
Typical neural networks today can grow to extremely large size: billions of parameters in the weights $\theta$. What if this neural network doesn't have a fixed structure? What if the neurons could dynamically adapt to the task at hand? This is the rapidly growing notions of [Liquid Neural Networks](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16936) inspired by the efficiency of the worm's brain, made up of merely 300 neurons.
:::


The Neural ODE paradigm has found breathtaking success, particularly against [ResNets](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html). The Liquid Neural Network on the other hand has shown jaw-dropping performance in autonomous driving. I believe those two could be combined within the __Liquid Neural ODE__, thus unlocking the secrets of consciousness.



## The parallel theory 

As a full-time daydreamer, I also believe any theory of the mind must account for the subconscious. Although not necessarily as envisioned by Sigmund Freud, since I don't believe those deeply abstract ideas are indispensable to replicating the human mind.

This is why I think there's a second computer at work in the back of our minds, even when we are awake. The same computer that quickly processes information and lets a car driver avoid pedestrians in an emergency situation. The kind of computer that shows us how we're all carrying [implicit biases](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html). The same one we make use of on first impressions. The computer in the background that professionals use to identify talent without even knowing things are happening, subconsciously.

If those ideas sound familiar, that's because they're collected from Malcolm Gladwell's bestselling book [Blink](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Blink-Audiobook/B004F2Z324). He repeatedly uses the terminology _thin slicing_. He describes a computer that, given sufficient time and experience in a domain, discards all useless information to make the quickest decisions for our assumed benefit. The moral of the book is, listen to your inner voice, and know when to ignore it.

So, how can this idea complement the Neural ODE (which represents our foreground mind in this analogy)? Well, we parallelise it. The function $f$ above, given a smaller input vector $y$ and smaller weights $\theta$, should return faster results at competitive accuracy. What I'm describing is combined data- and time-parallelisation (achieved by skipping certain synaptic connections). We train the Neural ODE on a __fine__ data-time domain, and we make sure its inference on a __coarser__ data-time domain is just as accurate.

Several works have investigated parallel ideas on Neural ODEs, namely [Gunther's](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/19M1247620) and [Massaroli's](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/89b9c689a57b82e59074c6ba09aa394d-Abstract.html). However, they only considered time (or layer) parallelism. Moreover, they focus on the training, rather than inference. Combining data and time for quick inference is a dream I hope to achieve before then end of my PhD (2025).


## Closing toughts

I'm currently investigating the feasibility of a data-time parallel Neural ODE. How would we test such an idea on the brain?  I have no clue yet. What I know is that I can start with my brain, as in the famous [Chinese Room](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/) argument.

If your mind finds itself drawn to these ideas, then maybe they're valid (as Searle says, "_always test the theory on yourself first_"). In that case, [send me a message](https://ddrous.github.io/about.html#contact-me). If you've heard these same ideas somewhere else and think I'm wasting my time or that there's room for collaboration, then please do reach out. If this sounds like complete nonsense to you, then maybe it is. But it shouldn't stop us from pursuing the truth, right ?

Please comment below for any insights you might have. And as always, thanks for reading !
