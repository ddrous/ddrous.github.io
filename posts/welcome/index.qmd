This is my first post in the FOS blog. Welcome!

I've never really owned a blog. Even though it's been on my mind for more than 2 years now.

Now that I've got a band new portfolio website, I feel like I'm never going to get a better opportunity than this to flesh out some of my ideas.

The previous iterations of my personal websites are not accessible anymore. But snapshoots can be found below.

Nothing was wrong with either of those versions. My only concern was that I couldn't write code like in iPython notebooks. That feature is something I rely on a lot for my Data Science tutorials.

This version of the FOS (version 3) website is built on Quarto which fully support in-line code cells in Python and Julia, my main scripting languages. It offered template more gorgeos than anything that I could've found anywhere else.

Now that you know my reasons for making these changes, you can tell me what you think. **Which version of FOS looks the best accoring to you** ?
