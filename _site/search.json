But snapshoots can be found below.\n\nPhoto of Version 1: FOS version 1\nPhoto of Version 2: FOS version 2\n\nNothing was wrong with either of those versions. My only concern was that I couldn’t write code like in iPython notebooks.

This is Rene Descarte’s legacy, whose remants we carry to this day.\nThis formulation dating back to the 1600s is convenient for it’s time, as it leaves the Realm of the Body to the science, and the Realm of the Mind to the church. Perfect if you’re a scientist wanting to conduct your research under the inquisitions.\nFinger pointing appart, this teory is appealing. But it leaves us with one big problem. How does the mind influence the brain ? How are the two realms connected ? Descarte’s answer to this puzzled was unconvinding.\nOver the centuries, several school of thoughts have emerged only considering one of the thoughts. The main groups being idealism and behaviourism. It would appear that the advent of computers and the emergence of the cross-disciplinary field of congnitive science is the key to this puzzle."

    "text": "3 A parallel theory\nAs a full-on daydreamer, I also believe any theory of the mind must account for the subconcious. Although not necessarily as decribed by Freud [REF] as I don’t believe those deeply abstract ideas are indispensable to replicating the human mind.\nThis is why I think there’s a second computer at work in the background of our minds, even when we are awake. The same computer that quickly processes information and let’s us avoid a car in an emergency situation. The kind of computer that shows us how we’re all carrying implict biases [REFs]. the same one we make use of on first impressions. The one professionals use to identify talent.\nIf those ideas sound familiar, that’s because the’re copied from Malcolm Gladwell’s betselling book Blink. He calls it thin slicing. A computer that, given sufficient experience in a domain, discards all unecassy information to make the quickest decisions critical for our survival. More often than none, the good one. The moral of the book is, listen to your inner voice, and know when to ignore it.\nSo how can this idea complement the Neural ODE (which represent our full mind in this analogy). Well, we parallelise it. The function \\(f\\), given a smaller input vector \\(y\\) and smaller weights \\(\\theta\\), should return faster results at competitive accuracy. What I’m describing is combined data- and time-parallastion. We solve the Neural ODE on a fine data-time domain, and we make sure it’s inference on a coarser data-time domain is just as accurate.\nSeveral works have investigated this idea on Neural ODE, namely Gunther [REF MULTIGRID IN TIME], Massaroli [REF DIFF LAYERS]. However, they only considered time (or layer) parallelism. Moreover, they focus on the training, rather than inference. Combinng at data and time for quick inference is a dream I hope to achieve before then end of my PhD (2025)."

The Liquid Neural Network on the other hand has shown jaw-dropping perforamnce in autonomous driving [REF MIT].
