    "text": "Hi there ! I’m Des, a PhD student in HPC-AI at the University of Bristol. I’m investigating parallel algorithms for combined data-driven and physics-informed simulation, control, and 3D reconstruction from fluid flows.\nMy research interests are at the intersection of Machine Learning, Scientific Computing, and High Performance Computing. They include:\n\nHow to best combine classical knowledge of physical systems with AI approaches ?\nHow to scale existing physics-based AI techniques to real-world engineering problems: this involves questions like strong/weak scaling and uncertainty quantification.\nWhat role do humans, and domain scientists in particular play in the envisionned symbiose above?\n\nTo learn more about me, you can consult the list of projects I’ve been involved in.
