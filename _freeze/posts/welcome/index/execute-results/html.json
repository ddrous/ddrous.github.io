This is my very first post on this blog. \n\n\nI've never really owned a blog, even though it has been on my mind for more than 2 years now. Now that I've got a brand-new portfolio website, I feel like I'm never going to get a better opportunity than this to flesh out some of my ideas.\n\nPrevious iterations of my personal websites might not be accessible anymore, but snapshoots can be found below.\n\n::: {layout-nrow=3}\n![Version 1 built with Jekyll based on the [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) template. This version is now [archived](https://github.com/ddrous/desmond-rn.github.io) on GitHub.](version1.png){width=300}\n\n![Version 2 built with ReactJS based on [Soumyajit's](https://github.com/ddrous/portfolio) template. This version is still [live](https://www.rousseldesnzoyem.com/), although not for long.](version2.png){width=300}\n\n![Version 3 built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and using the `yeti` (light) and `superhero` (dark) themes. This is the [site](https://ddrous.github.io/) you're currently browsing.](version3.png){width=400}\n:::\n\n\nI cannot say what was wrong with versions 1 and 2. My biggest concern was that I couldn't write code like in iPython notebooks. The coding feature is something I value a lot for Data Science tutorials. The current iteration (version 3) is built on Quarto which fully supports in-line code cells in `Python` and `Julia`, my top 2 scripting languages. It offered a template more gorgeous than anything that I found elsewhere.\n\nNow that you know my reasons for making these changes, you can tell me which version you think is best. You can react below with üëç for version 1, üéâ for version 2, or ‚ù§Ô∏è for version 3. The comment section is handled via [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), so you need to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to be able to react or leave a comment. It's super easy though. \n\n\nPlease go ahead and tell me which one's preferable so that I can incorporate the best of what that version has to offer. As always, thanks for reading !\n",
